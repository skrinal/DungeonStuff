BIG W SHORTCUTS
- Ctrl + h = replace all same words;
- F5 compile
- ctrl + shift + F5 = reload


TO DO LIST
- Make Allies(left) / Enemies(right) outputs in corners

- If Normal, Hard, Inferno choosen assigne value to INT and make multiplayers
Make difficulty multiplayer: Normal(1x) , Hard(1.5x / 2x), Inferno (2x / 2.5x)
- difficulties still not done. (make later on)


SOME IDEAS
- Migh make MAP smaller so backbpack can be seen OR make backpack visible only while in combat

// Replace Enemies while on MAP with backpack and add enemies only while fighting
